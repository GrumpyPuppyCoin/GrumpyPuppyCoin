### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

We have been looking at the future of NFTs, Crypto, and Music and determined 3 projects where our coin will advance this new art age.  

This first project, The Woof Network, is planned to be a social media network designed for NFTs. Think of Twitter but every post is an NFT that you recently purchased that you could share with your friends. There will be a like/comment system to see how others react and you can follow your favorite people to see what they are buying too. 
To support this model and move away from expensive ETH gas fees we plan to also create a marketplace that artists can list their NFTs. The goal of this marketplace is more affordable NFTs so that everyone can share and join in. This would give artists another place to promote their NFTs and have their works shared more than just twitter. Since we would own the marketplace, we would use GRMPP to purchase the NFTs to use on the network and would build in the wallet to your social profile. 

The second project would be the Digital Dog House. The Dog House will be like the Digital Smithsonian of NFTs with various breakout spaces for artists to collaborate and will also have a performance area to bring in Musical Artists from around the globe. It would be wall to wall of NFTs purchased by the team/organization. The NFTs that would be purchased would be from new artists all over the world as we find them. The goal would be to buy one NFT from every artist to make the worldâ€™s largest NFT collection. It would have exhibits of your favorite peopleâ€™s NFTs and displaying them as they buy them. With the constant purchases of NFTs, these exhibits would change weekly if not daily. 

The third project is the physical Dog House. Since there would only be one, we plan to ask all of our GRMPP holders to vote on a place in the world where the real Dog House will be built. The physical Dog House will be just as massive as the digital version and will have the same areas as stated. With the physical building we will attract more people that are not in the NFT world. 

We will make a place where NFTs, Crypto, and Music Converge. Join Us!
